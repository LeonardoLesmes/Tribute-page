                    <h4>History</h4>                 
                    <p>
                        Michael Faraday was an English scientist who contributed to the study of electromagnetism and
                        electrochemistry. His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic
                        induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis.</p>
                    <p>
                        Faraday had a long association with the Royal Institution of Great Britain. He was appointed
                        Assistant Superintendent of the House of the Royal Institution in 1821. Beyond his scientific
                        research
                        into areas such as chemistry, electricity, and magnetism at the Royal Institution, Faraday
                        undertook
                        numerous, and often time-consuming, service projects for private enterprise and the British
                        government.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Between 1827 and 1860 at the Royal Institution in London, Faraday gave a series of nineteen
                        Christmas lectures for young people, a series which continues today. The objective of Faraday's
                        Christmas lectures was to present science to the general public in the hopes of inspiring them
                        and
                        generating revenue for the Royal Institution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Faraday's life and contributions to electromagnetics was the principal topic of the tenth episode, titled "The Electric Boy", of the 2014 American science documentary series, Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, which was broadcast on Fox and the National Geographic Channel.

                    <h4>Experiments and results</h4>
                    <ul id="experiments-list">
                        <li>Faraday invented an early form of what was to become the Bunsen burner, which is in
                            practical use in science laboratories around the world as a convenient source of heat.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The momopolar motor caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular
                            magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of mercury wherein was placed a
                            magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a
                            chemical battery.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Faraday's breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around an iron ring,
                            and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary current was induced in
                            the other coil. This phenomenon is now known as mutual induction. The iron ring-coil
                            apparatus is still on display at the Royal Institution.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Near the end of his career, Faraday proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the
                            empty space around the conductor. This idea was rejected by his fellow scientists, and
                            Faraday did not live to see the eventual acceptance of his proposition by the scientific
                            community. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets
                            provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields; that conceptual model was crucial
                            for the successful development of the electromechanical devices that dominated engineering
                            and industry for the remainder of the 19th century.</li>
